# Bible Verse Finder

This is a simple web application that I've built for my friend to help him find Bible verses quickly. It uses Next.js for the frontend and the [Bolls Bible API](https://bolls.life/api/) to fetch the verses.

## Features

- Search for Bible verses by word or phrase.
- View each verse found and its reference.
- Animations for a smooth user experience.

## How to Run

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/emanuelefavero/bible-verse-finder.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd bible-verse-finder
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.
